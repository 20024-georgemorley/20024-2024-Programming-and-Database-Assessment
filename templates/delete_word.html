<!--This page is created depending upon the word selected by the user in any of the pages that display a list of words.
This data is parsed from the corresponding word_page, and then is sent to this page. The user has either the option to
decline to delete, which will send them back to the main dictionary page where they can view more words, or they can
choose yes, which will send the word information to the corresponding render_template and delete the data from the
dictionary table. This page does not output any data, only receives input from the user.-->
